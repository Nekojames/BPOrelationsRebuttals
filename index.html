Script 1: Tailored Permission OpenerCaller: Hi [Prospect Name], this is [Your Name] from the Loan Assistance Center. I‚Äôm gonna be upfront ‚Äì this is a cold call, but it‚Äôs a well-researched one.

Can I take 30 seconds to explain why I‚Äôm reaching out? If it‚Äôs not relevant, you can hang up, no hard feelings.

Prospect: Sure, go ahead.

Caller: I‚Äôm calling because many of our clients are finding that with rising expenses, consolidating their high-interest debts can really help free up their monthly budget.

With our 5.99% low-interest personal loans, people have been able to cut their monthly payments in half and reduce their financial stress.

Would you be open to learning a bit more when I‚Äôm not completely catching you out of the blue?

Script 2: Heard the Name Tossed Around OpenerCaller: Hey [Prospect Name], we‚Äôve helped quite a few people in your area manage their finances better.

It‚Äôs [Your Name] from the Loan Assistance Center.

Heard the name tossed around?

Prospect: Not sure, maybe. What‚Äôs this about?

Caller: Well, the reason I‚Äôm calling is that a lot of folks have been using our 5.99% low-interest personal loans to consolidate their debt and save hundreds of dollars each month.

I figured it might be worth a quick chat if you‚Äôre open to it?

Script 3: Untailored Permission OpenerCaller: Hey [Prospect Name], my name is [Your Name] from the Loan Assistance Center. You‚Äôre gonna hate me, but this is indeed a cold call.

Mind if I take 30 seconds to share why I called you specifically? If it doesn‚Äôt make sense, you can totally hang up.

Prospect: Alright, what is it?

Caller: We‚Äôre reaching out because a lot of people are looking for ways to reduce their financial stress, and our 5.99% low-interest personal loans have been a real game changer for those consolidating their higher-interest debts.

Think it‚Äôs worth a quick chat to see if this could help you out as well?


                
VERIFICATION 
I want to check if we got your details correct.
Name (spelling)
Phone number 
Email 
Complete home address
Estimated monthly income 

Lastly, I will need to do a soft credit check before connecting you with a loan specialist. This will not affect your credit score in any way.
For this, I'll just need to confirm your date of birth.
Ok, and you're social.

I'm submitting this to the underwriting department now, and it'll just take a few minutes to verify your status (Note: While waiting for the result, take the opportunity to build rapport with the lead. Engage in light conversation)
Stalling questions : 
How much do you owe with your other debts? 
Out of curiosity, how much interest do they charge you with your current loans.
What are your plans if you got approved?                

STATUS DECLINED (Loan CR Agent): Unfortunately, you don't meet the minimum requirements right now, but you're welcome to apply with us again in 60/90 days.
STATUS APPROVED (Loan CR Agent): It looks like you meet the minimum requirements, so we can proceed with transferring you to our specialist.

HANDOFF

    We work with credit bureaus to find pre-qualified individuals like you. Everything‚Äôs protected by federal law and strict privacy standards.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Hesitant to Provide SSN</strong>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>We only ask your SSN to confirm identity and unlock accurate loan terms. No impact on your credit, no risk to your info.</li>
      <li>Without it, lenders legally can‚Äôt show you real offers. We use bank-level security to keep your info safe.</li>
      <li>It‚Äôs like unlocking a door‚Äîyou can‚Äôt see what‚Äôs inside until it‚Äôs open. We protect your data and never share it.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>What company is this?</strong><br>
    We‚Äôre Loan Assistance Center‚Äîlicensed and partnered with top U.S. lenders to help people get better loan options fast and securely.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Don‚Äôt do a soft pull, I have bad credit.</strong><br>
    No worries‚Äîthis is exactly why we‚Äôre here. Bad credit doesn‚Äôt disqualify you, and soft pulls don‚Äôt affect your score at all.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Wrong SSN or Info</strong><br>
    Even one small mismatch can block your approval. Let‚Äôs get it right now so your application doesn‚Äôt get delayed.
  </li>

"Totally understand, and just so you know, I‚Äôm not here to sell you anything right now.
My job‚Äôs just to see if you‚Äôd even qualify for the 5.99% promo‚Äîit‚Äôs a soft check, no obligation, and it won‚Äôt touch your credit score. 
You might actually already be eligible."

"Out of curiosity‚Äîare you carrying any high-interest debt right now? This offer‚Äôs helped a lot of people cut their payments nearly in half."
If they still hesitate:

"No worries‚Äîit‚Äôs just a quick pre-check. Worst case, you'll lose 5 mins, not qualify.
Best case, you save on interest while the promo‚Äôs still active.
Totally up to you, but it‚Äôs free to find out."
        <li>
      <li>Got it‚Äîbut if you‚Äôve got debt or expenses, this could drop your payments or free up cash. 2 minutes now is worth it.</li>
      <li>This isn‚Äôt adding debt‚Äîit‚Äôs a reset. Lower interest, more control. Just checking eligibility‚Äîno pressure.</li>
      <li>Most people who said that ended up qualifying‚Äîand saving big. If it‚Äôs not for you, no harm. But you might be glad you looked.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>What‚Äôs your exact location?</strong><br>
    We‚Äôre based in Irvine, California‚Äî2525 Main Street, across from John Wayne Airport. Everything we do is licensed, secure, and transparent.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>I don‚Äôt have time.</strong><br>
    Totally get it‚Äîthat‚Äôs why we made this fast. A couple of minutes now could save you thousands. This offer won‚Äôt wait.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Why unlock my account for a soft pull?</strong><br>
    We can‚Äôt see your credit unless it‚Äôs unlocked‚Äîbut it‚Äôs only a soft pull. No impact, no risk. Just lets us get you accurate terms.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>What‚Äôs your website or address?</strong><br>
    Happy to send it over securely‚Äîbut first, let‚Äôs verify so we only send the right info to the right person.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Why don‚Äôt you have my information?</strong><br>
    We pull from multiple sources, but to be precise, we verify directly with you. That‚Äôs how we avoid errors and get real offers to you.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>How are you different from other lenders?</strong><br>
    We work for you‚Äînot just the lender. Rates start at 5.99%, with no collateral. It‚Äôs fast, safe, and built to actually help you.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Soft Pull vs. Hard Pull?</strong><br>
    A soft pull checks your options with zero effect on your credit. Hard pulls only happen if you move forward. You‚Äôre always in control.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Why do you need my email?</strong><br>
    That‚Äôs how we send your offer details, securely and instantly. It keeps your application moving with no delays.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>I want info via email first.</strong><br>
    Absolutely‚Äîwe just need to confirm a few basics so the info we send is real, accurate, and meant for you.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>I don‚Äôt have an email.</strong><br>
    No problem. If a friend or family member has one, we can use theirs for paperwork. If not, we‚Äôll use a secure placeholder.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Doesn‚Äôt Want to Talk to Loan Specialist</strong><br>
    I get it‚Äîbut this isn‚Äôt a sales pitch. Our advisors help people get approved faster, with better terms. It‚Äôs free, fast, and worth hearing.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Already Handled by Closer</strong><br>
    I see you‚Äôve already spoken with our Senior Loan Advisor, [Name]. I‚Äôll reconnect you now so they can pick up where you left off.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Credit Pull Returns ‚ÄúNo Record Found‚Äù</strong><br>
    That usually means something‚Äôs off‚Äîmaybe a typo in name or address. Let‚Äôs double-check it so we don‚Äôt lose your spot.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Why do I need to unlock my account for the soft pull?</strong><br>
    It‚Äôs required to access your profile securely. No charges, no credit impact‚Äîjust a standard step to get your personalized loan terms.
