This is (Your Name) with the Personal Loan Intake Department. I'm calling regarding the personal loan offer we sent you in the mail at a promotional interest rate starting at 5.99% (five-point nine nine percent), which is set to expire this week!

I just need to verify a few details to make sure you meet the minimum requirements. This will only take a few minutes. First, can you do me a favor and confirm that I have the correct spelling of your name. I have: J-O-H-N S-M-I-T-H. Is that correct? Perfect, thank you!

And the best number to reach you is (123) 456-7890, right?
What is the best email address to reach you at?
Next, could you please confirm your current address? Complete street city state zip code 
What is your monthly take-home after taxes?

Lastly, I will need to do a soft credit check before connecting you with a loan specialist. This will not affect your credit score in any way.
For this, I'll just need to confirm your date of birth.
Ok, and you're social.

I'm submitting this to the underwriting department now, and it'll just take a few minutes to verify your status.
(Note: While waiting for the result, take the opportunity to build rapport with the lead. Engage in light conversation)

                    step we take is with full accountability and integrity. This process was built to protect you while
                    opening the door to real opportunities. </li>
                <li class="objection-item"><strong>2. Hesitant to Provide SSN</strong> - YYour security matters and
                    that’s
                    why we use bank-level encryption to protect your SSN at every step. We don’t ask for information we
                    don’t need. This allows us to verify your identity and secure the best offers on your behalf—without
                    affecting your credit or exposing your data. It’s the safest way to move forward with full
                    confidence.
                </li>
                <li class="objection-item"><strong>3. “What company is this?”</strong> - We’re Loan Assistance Center
                    trusted partners of top-tier lenders across the country. Our job is to simplify your process, cut
                    through the noise, and connect you with real, affordable options. We’re not here to sell—we’re here
                    to
                    solve, and we do it with professionalism, speed, and purpose. </li>
                <li class="objection-item"><strong>4. “Don’t do a soft pull—I have bad credit.”</strong> - Bad credit
                    doesn’t stop us it just gives us more to work with. Our lenders evaluate your full profile, not just
                    a
                    number. And because this is a soft pull, your score stays completely untouched. It’s your shot at a
                    smarter financial path without risk or penalty. </li>
                <li class="objection-item"><strong>5. Wrong SSN or Info</strong> - To proceed, our system needs
                    verified,
                    accurate information to match you with the right lender. A single mismatch could delay or block your
                    approval. Correcting it now ensures your eligibility and keeps the process seamless from here. </li>
                <li class="objection-item"><strong>6. “I’m not interested” / “Not looking for a loan”</strong> -
                    Completely
                    understand—but what we’re offering isn’t just a loan—it’s a financial reset. Whether you’re facing
                    high-interest debt, unexpected expenses, or just want flexibility, this solution puts control back
                    in
                    your hands. When real options are on the table, walking away means walking away from relief. </li>
                <li class="objection-item"><strong>7. “What’s your exact location?”</strong> - We’re based in Irvine,
                    California, and we work exclusively with a national network of vetted lenders. Once you’re
                    pre-qualified, you’ll get full transparency about the lender, terms, and next steps. Every piece of
                    this
                    process is built on trust, clarity, and compliance. 2525 Main St, Irvine, CA 92614 in front of John

                <li class="objection-item"><strong>8. “I don’t have time.”</strong> - That’s exactly why we streamlined
                    this
                    process to take just minutes. What you do today could impact your financial freedom for years. And
                    this
                    limited-time offer doesn’t wait. We’re ready when you are. </li>
                <li class="objection-item"><strong>9. “Why unlock my account for a soft pull?”</strong> - Your account
                    needs
                    to be unlocked so we can complete a risk-free soft inquiry—which has zero effect on your credit
                    score.
                    It’s quick, secure, and the only way we can present accurate, personalized loan terms. It keeps you
                    in
                    control, without compromise.</li>
                <li class="objection-item"><strong>10. “What’s your website or address?”</strong> - Happy to provide all
                    official info—but to protect your identity, we only send sensitive credentials through secure email.
                    That ensures you’re getting verified information directly from underwriting—accurately, safely, and
                    without delay. </li>
                <li class="objection-item"><strong>11. “Why don’t you have my information?”</strong> - We pull data from
                    multiple sources, but to prevent errors or mismatches, we verify directly with you. This ensures
                    that
                    what we send is accurate, tailored, and fully aligned with what you qualify for. No wasted time. No
                    missed opportunity.</li>
                <li class="objection-item"><strong>12. “How are you different from other lenders?”</strong> - Unlike
                    traditional lenders, we fight for your best terms. You get access to low fixed rates starting at
                    5.99%,
                    no collateral required, and real approvals based on your overall financial story—not just your
                    credit
                    score. Add in faster funding and airtight security, and this becomes the smarter, safer way to
                    borrow.
                </li>
                <li class="objection-item"><strong>13. “Soft Pull vs. Hard Pull?”</strong> - A soft pull lets us check
                    your
                    pre-approval status without touching your credit score. It’s invisible to other lenders and leaves
                    zero
                    impact. Hard pulls come later, only with your full consent—but right now, all we’re doing is
                    exploring
                    your best options safely and smartly. </li>
                <li class="objection-item"><strong>14. “Why do you need my email?”</strong> - Your email is the direct
                    line
                    for critical documents, updates, and approvals. It ensures you receive everything in real
                    time—securely
                    and without any delays. This keeps your process smooth, accurate, and fully protected from start to
                    finish. </li>
                <li class="objection-item"><strong>15. “I want info via email first.”</strong> - Absolutely—we respect
                    that.
                    First, we need to confirm key details to make sure the offer we send is real and accurate. Once
                    that’s
                    done, your personalized loan options will be delivered straight to your inbox—secure, tailored, and
                    ready for review….</li>
                <li class="objection-item"><strong>16. “I don’t have an email.”</strong> - That’s completely
                    understandable.
                    But what you’re missing isn’t a sales pitch—it’s a real conversation that could lead to a better
                    rate,
                    faster approval, or bigger savings. It’s free, fast, and handled by experts who are here to help—not
                    pressure. When people hear what’s actually available to them, they’re glad they took the call. </li>
                <li class="objection-item"><strong>17. Doesn’t Want to Talk to Loan Specialist</strong> - That’s
                    completely
                    understandable. But what you’re missing isn’t a sales pitch—it’s a real conversation that could lead
