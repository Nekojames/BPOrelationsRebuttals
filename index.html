PERSONAL LOAN OFFER (With Intonation & Pacing)

Agent:
Hi, is this [Client Name]? ↑ (friendly, upward tone)

Hey [Client Name], this is [Your Name] from the Personal Loan Intake Team. ↓ (confident, steady tone)
I help people get fast, simple access to personal loans—without the usual hassle. ↓

You’ve been pre-screened for a personal loan starting as low as 5.99%,
and the offer is set to expire in just a few days. ↑ (use urgency here)
So I wanted to make sure you had the chance to check it out before it’s gone. ↓

It’ll just take about 5 minutes, and don’t worry—this won’t affect your credit score. ↓ (reassuring tone, steady pace)
Mind if I ask you a few quick questions? ↑ (upbeat and inviting)


Verification Questions:
Alright, let me just confirm some quick details: ↓

Your name is spelled J-O-H-N S-M-I-T-H, right? ↓

And your best number is (123) 456-7890? ↓

What’s your best email address? ↓

Can you confirm your full mailing address—street, city, state, and ZIP? ↓

And what’s your monthly income after taxes? ↓



Soft Credit Check Setup:
Okay, last step before I transfer you to a loan specialist:
We just need to run a soft credit check to confirm your eligibility. ↓
This will not affect your credit score in any way. ↓ (pause briefly here)

For that, I just need to confirm your date of birth, and the last four digits of your Social. ↓ (calm, non-pushy)


If They Hesitate (Objection Handling):
I totally get that. ↑ (empathetic, gentle)
Just to reassure you—this is encrypted, not stored, and only used to confirm your identity. ↓
In fact, it actually helps protect you, so nobody else can access this offer in your name. ↓

And again, this soft check won’t touch your credit score. ↓ (reaffirm gently)

Objection: “Where did you get my info?”
That’s a great question. ↑
You didn’t sign up directly—but your info came from a credit bureau’s pre-screen list. ↓
We work with providers who use that list to offer lower-rate loan options to folks who may qualify. ↓

It’s a secure, one-time use, and your data is never sold or reused. ↓


IF APPROVED:
Awesome—it looks like you meet the requirements! ↑
I’m now going to connect you with a licensed loan specialist who’ll walk you through the best options. ↓ (smooth, enthusiastic)


IF DECLINED:
Thanks for your time, [Client Name]. ↓
Right now, it looks like you don’t meet the minimum requirements—
but you’re welcome to reapply in 60 to 90 days if anything changes. ↓ (kind, respectful tone)


HANDOFF SECTION

To Specialist:
Hi [Specialist Name], I’ve got [Client Name] on the line. ↓
File number is [Logixx File Number]. ↓
They’ve been verified and meet all the minimum requirements.
Can you walk them through the available loan options?

To Client:
[Client Name], thanks so much for holding. ↓
I’ve got our loan specialist [Specialist Name] on the line now— 
they’ll guide you through the rest. ↓
Thanks again, and I hope you both have a great day! ↑
