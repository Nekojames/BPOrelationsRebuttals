    <strong>Why do you need my email?</strong><br>
    I understand your concern. Your email is the direct line for critical documents, updates, and approvals. It ensures you receive everything in real time without any delays. This keeps your process smooth, accurate, and fully protected from start to finish.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>I'm not sure I want to give that info</strong><br>
    I understand your concern. I won‚Äôt ask for any information that you need to worry about. These are just basic questions, and this will not be shared with anyone. Your information will be safe. My job is to pre-qualify people who may be eligible for this loan.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>I did not apply for this</strong><br>
    I understand your concern and I don't want you to miss this opportunity. This is a time-sensitive program that can provide you with a promotional interest rate as low as <strong>5.99%</strong>. (Go back to POI)
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Not interested</strong><br>
    I completely understand‚Äîbut what we‚Äôre offering isn‚Äôt just a loan‚Äîit‚Äôs a financial reset. Whether you‚Äôre facing high-interest debt, unexpected expenses, or planning a home renovation, this solution gives you control.<br>
    You may qualify for up to <strong>$100,000</strong>, with <strong>no obligation</strong> to proceed. This could be your chance to finally become <strong>100% debt-free</strong>.<br><br>
    OR<br><br>
    I completely understand that this might not be what you're looking for right now. However, this loan could act as a safety net for unexpected expenses. You‚Äôll be glad to know that it doesn't require collateral and can save you money. We‚Äôre not here to push‚Äîwe‚Äôre here to support and help you get back on track.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SSN Concerns</strong><br>
    I completely understand your concern, and I want to assure you that your privacy and security are our top priorities. Every piece of information you provide, including your SSN, is fully encrypted and stored securely. We use bank-level encryption to protect your SSN and only ask for what‚Äôs necessary to verify your identity and get you the best offers‚Äîwithout affecting your credit.
    or
   <br>
      I understand your concerns about providing your personal information. However, I assure you it will remain private and secure. We use bank-level encryption to protect your SSN at every step. Also, if for any reason you're not qualified for the loan, our system will automatically delete your file, and we‚Äôll simply part ways.  So could please confirm me your SSN please?


BUT I NEED YOUR SOCIAL TO DETERMINE YOUR ELIGIBILITY TO CHECK THE BEST PROGRAM

and this will not be shared for anyone
- only used for verification purposes

The reason I‚Äôm asking for your Social is because it‚Äôs one of the ways we verify your identity. This is just a one-time requirement. Once you're qualified, I‚Äôll transfer you to my loan specialist, who will provide all the details about the loan. So, may I have your Social, please?
</li>

  <li>
    <strong>If SSN is incorrect or not complete</strong><br>
    To proceed, our system needs verified, accurate information to match you with the right lender. A single mismatch could delay or block your approval. We need the 9 digits of your Social Security Number to perform a soft credit check. Don‚Äôt worry, this won‚Äôt affect your credit score.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Location</strong><br>
    We‚Äôre based at <strong>2525 Main St, Irvine, CA 92614</strong> in front of John Wayne Airport. We work exclusively with a national network of vetted lenders. Once you‚Äôre pre-qualified, you‚Äôll receive full transparency about the lender, terms, and next steps.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Website request</strong><br>
    Happy to provide all official info‚Äîbut to protect your identity, we only send sensitive credentials through secure email. That ensures you‚Äôre getting verified information directly from underwriting‚Äîaccurately, safely, and without delay.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>No time</strong><br>
    I know your time is important. That‚Äôs exactly why we streamlined this process to take just minutes. What you do today could impact your financial future, and this limited-time offer doesn‚Äôt wait.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Send email</strong><br>
    We absolutely respect your preference to receive information via email first, and we're happy to accommodate that. However, to ensure we send the most accurate and relevant details, we need to confirm a few essential pieces of information first.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Company name</strong><br>
    We are <strong>Loan Assistance Center</strong>, trusted partners of top-tier lenders across the country. Our job is to simplify your process and connect you with real lenders and affordable options. Located at <strong>2525 Main St, Irvine, CA 92614</strong>.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Doesn't want to talk to the specialist</strong><br>
    That‚Äôs completely understandable. But what you‚Äôre missing isn‚Äôt a sales pitch‚Äîit‚Äôs a real conversation that could lead to a better rate, faster approval, or bigger savings. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre connecting you to our specialist‚Äîthey‚Äôre here to help, not pressure.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Why are you transferring me?</strong><br>
    Our next step is to connect you to our licensed loan specialist, who will provide options and help sign you up so that you get your loan as soon as possible.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>I have bad credit</strong><br>
    Bad credit doesn‚Äôt stop us‚Äîit just gives us more to work with. Our lenders evaluate your full profile, not just a number. And because this is a soft pull, your score stays completely untouched.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Soft pull credit</strong><br>
    A soft pull will check your pre-approval status without touching your credit score. It‚Äôs invisible to other lenders and leaves zero impact.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Don't have email</strong><br>
    No problem. If a trusted friend or family member has one, we can use it temporarily for your paperwork. If not, we‚Äôll use a secure placeholder to keep your application moving forward without delay.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Name of the specialist</strong><br>
    I don‚Äôt have a specific name because we have many specialists. Once I connect you, they will introduce themselves directly to you.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Different from other lenders</strong><br>
    Unlike traditional lenders, we fight for your best terms. You get access to low fixed rates starting at <strong>5.99%</strong>, no collateral required, and approvals based on your full financial profile‚Äînot just your credit score.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Interest rate</strong><br>
    Our rates start at just <strong>5.99%</strong>, which can save you significantly compared to many other options available in the market.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Email first (again)</strong><br>
    Absolutely‚Äîwe respect that. First, we need to confirm key details to ensure the offer we send is real and accurate. Then your personalized loan options will be delivered securely to your inbox.
