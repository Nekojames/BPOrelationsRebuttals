Neko's Awesome! COLD CALL SCRIPT – PERSONAL LOAN OFFER (With Intonation & Pacing)

Agent:
Hi, is this [Client Name]? ↑ (friendly, upward tone)

Hey [Client Name], this is [Your Name] from the Personal Loan Intake Team. ↓ (confident, steady tone)
I help people get fast, simple access to personal loans—without the usual hassle. ↓

You’ve been pre-screened for a personal loan starting as low as 5.99%,
and the offer is set to expire in just a few days. ↑ (use urgency here)
So I wanted to make sure you had the chance to check it out before it’s gone. ↓

It’ll just take about 5 minutes, and don’t worry—this won’t affect your credit score. ↓ (reassuring tone, steady pace)
Mind if I ask you a few quick questions? ↑ (upbeat and inviting)


Verification Questions:
Alright, let me just confirm some quick details: ↓

Your name is spelled J-O-H-N S-M-I-T-H, right? ↓

And your best number is (123) 456-7890? ↓

What’s your best email address? ↓

Can you confirm your full mailing address—street, city, state, and ZIP? ↓

And what’s your monthly income after taxes? ↓



Soft Credit Check Setup:
Okay, last step before I transfer you to a loan specialist:
We just need to run a soft credit check to confirm your eligibility. ↓
This will not affect your credit score in any way. ↓ (pause briefly here)

For that, I just need to confirm your date of birth, and the last four digits of your Social. ↓ (calm, non-pushy)


If They Hesitate (Objection Handling):
I totally get that. ↑ (empathetic, gentle)
Just to reassure you—this is encrypted, not stored, and only used to confirm your identity. ↓
In fact, it actually helps protect you, so nobody else can access this offer in your name. ↓

And again, this soft check won’t touch your credit score. ↓ (reaffirm gently)

Objection: “Where did you get my info?”
That’s a great question. ↑
You didn’t sign up directly—but your info came from a credit bureau’s pre-screen list. ↓
We work with providers who use that list to offer lower-rate loan options to folks who may qualify. ↓

It’s a secure, one-time use, and your data is never sold or reused. ↓


IF APPROVED:
Awesome—it looks like you meet the requirements! ↑
I’m now going to connect you with a licensed loan specialist who’ll walk you through the best options. ↓ (smooth, enthusiastic)


IF DECLINED:
Thanks for your time, [Client Name]. ↓
Right now, it looks like you don’t meet the minimum requirements—
but you’re welcome to reapply in 60 to 90 days if anything changes. ↓ (kind, respectful tone)


HANDOFF SECTION

To Specialist:
Hi [Specialist Name], I’ve got [Client Name] on the line. ↓
File number is [Logixx File Number]. ↓
They’ve been verified and meet all the minimum requirements.
Can you walk them through the available loan options?

To Client:
[Client Name], thanks so much for holding. ↓
I’ve got our loan specialist [Specialist Name] on the line now—
they’ll guide you through the rest. ↓
Thanks again, and I hope you both have a great day! ↑      </textarea>

            <h2>Objections and Rebuttals</h2>
            <input type="text" id="search" placeholder="Search Objection...">
            <ul id="objections" class="objections-list">
                <li><strong>1. "How did you get my information?"</strong><br>
We work with secure, verified sources to identify people who might benefit from our financial solutions. Our goal is <em>simple</em>: connect you with the right options without the hassle. We take privacy seriously, so your information is always protected.
<span class="intonation">(Pause briefly after 'simple' to let this sink in. Use a confident, reassuring tone. Rising intonation on 'simple' and falling intonation on 'protected'.)</span></li>

<li><strong>2. Hesitant to Provide SSN</strong><br>
I completely understand. We only ask for your SSN to confirm your identity and match you with the best offers. It’s <em>fully encrypted</em>, secure, and never shared without your consent. We’re here to make this easy, not risky.
<span class="intonation">(Slow down on 'fully encrypted' to emphasize security. Use a calm, trustworthy tone. Rising intonation on 'fully encrypted' and falling on 'without your consent'.)</span></li>

<li><strong>3. "What company is this?"</strong><br>
We’re the Loan Assistance Center. We partner with a network of trusted lenders to help you find the right financial fit without the <em>runaround</em>. Our mission is to make your financial journey simpler, faster, and more transparent.
<span class="intonation">(Pause after 'runaround' for impact. Use a professional but approachable tone. Slight rise on 'runaround' and confident fall on 'transparent'.)</span></li>

<li><strong>4. "Don’t do a soft pull—I have bad credit."</strong><br>
Totally get it. But here’s the thing—a soft pull won’t affect your score. It’s a quick, risk-free way to see what you qualify for without the pressure. Why not see what options are on the table?
<span class="intonation">(Pause after 'totally get it' to show empathy. Use a confident, reassuring tone. Rising intonation on 'risk-free' and falling on 'pressure'.)</span></li>

<li><strong>5. Wrong SSN or Info</strong><br>
No problem. We just need accurate, verified information to make sure you’re matched with the right options. It’s all about keeping things smooth and hassle-free.
<span class="intonation">(Use a supportive tone, like a friendly reminder. Rising slightly on 'accurate' and falling on 'hassle-free'.)</span></li>

<li><strong>6. "I’m not interested" / "Not looking for a loan."</strong><br>
I hear you, and I respect that. But just to be clear, this isn’t just a loan offer. It’s about finding a financial solution that actually makes a difference. Would you be open to hearing a bit more about what that might look like?
<span class="intonation">(Slow down slightly to show understanding. Use a warm, non-pushy tone. Rising intonation on 'difference' and sincere fall on 'look like'.)</span></li>

<li><strong>7. "What’s your exact location?"</strong><br>
We’re based in Irvine, California, and we work exclusively with a national network of vetted lenders. Once you’re pre-qualified, you’ll get full transparency about the lender, terms, and next steps. Every piece of this process is built on trust, clarity, and compliance.
<span class="intonation">(Provide information clearly with a calm tone. Rising intonation on 'trust' and falling intonation on 'compliance'.)</span></li>

<li><strong>8. "I don’t have time."</strong><br>
I completely understand. That’s why we’ve made the process as quick as possible. Just a few minutes could change the course of your financial future. And this is a limited-time opportunity, so timing is important.
<span class="intonation">(Slow down to make this sound more impactful. Use a slightly faster pace towards 'limited-time opportunity' to create urgency.)</span></li>

<li><strong>9. "Why unlock my account for a soft pull?"</strong><br>
To proceed, your account needs to be unlocked so we can complete a soft pull, which doesn’t affect your credit score. It’s a quick, secure step to ensure we can offer the best terms possible for you.
<span class="intonation">(Pause briefly after 'quick' to create emphasis. Rising intonation on 'best' and falling tone on 'possible'.)</span></li>

<li><strong>10. "What’s your website or address?"</strong><br>
We’d be happy to provide that information. However, for your safety, we only send sensitive details through secure email. This ensures that everything you receive is accurate, verified, and sent securely.
<span class="intonation">(Use a calm and professional tone. Rising on 'sensitive' and falling on 'securely'.)</span></li>

<li><strong>11. "Why don’t you have my information?"</strong><br>
We work with multiple sources, but we always verify directly with you. This ensures we have accurate, tailored information to make sure you get the right offers without any confusion or missed opportunities.
<span class="intonation">(Use a reassuring tone. Rising slightly on 'tailored' and falling on 'missed opportunities'.)</span></li>

<li><strong>12. "How are you different from other lenders?"</strong><br>
We’re different because we put your financial well-being first. You’ll have access to low fixed rates starting at 5.99%, with no collateral required, and we approve based on your full financial profile—not just your credit score.
<span class="intonation">(Confident tone. Rising intonation on 'access' and strong fall on 'profile'.)</span></li>

<li><strong>13. "Soft Pull vs. Hard Pull?"</strong><br>
A soft pull allows us to check your pre-qualification status without affecting your credit score. It’s completely invisible to other lenders. A hard pull happens only when you’ve given full consent, so there’s no risk involved at this stage.
<span class="intonation">(Use a calm tone, rising on 'risk' and falling on 'stage'.)</span></li>

<li><strong>14. "Why do you need my email?"</strong><br>
Your email ensures that you get all the critical updates, documents, and approvals in real-time, securely. It keeps everything streamlined and helps us stay in touch without delays.
<span class="intonation">(Slow down for clarity. Rising on 'updates' and falling on 'without delays'.)</span></li>

<li><strong>15. "I want info via email first."</strong><br>
Absolutely, we respect your preference. To send the most accurate offer, we first need to confirm a few key details with you. Once that’s done, your personalized options will be delivered directly to your inbox—securely and right on time.
<span class="intonation">(Use a friendly tone, rising on 'personalized' and falling on 'right on time'.)</span></li>

<li><strong>16. "I don’t have an email."</strong><br>
That’s okay! But here’s the thing: missing this opportunity means missing out on options that could really benefit you. It’s quick, it’s easy, and our team is here to help—not pressure you.
<span class="intonation">(Use a friendly, empathetic tone. Rising on 'missing out' and falling on 'not pressure you'.)</span></li>

<li><strong>17. Doesn’t Want to Talk to Loan Specialist</strong><br>
I completely understand. But what you’re missing is not a sales pitch. It’s an opportunity to learn about financial solutions that could save you money and offer a better path forward. We’re here to help, not to push—just to guide you through your options.
<span class="intonation">(Use a warm, reassuring tone. Rising on 'save you money' and falling on 'better path forward'.)</span></li>

<li><strong>18. When You Encounter a Customer Already Handled by a Closer</strong><br>
I see here that you’ve spoken with our Senior Loan Advisor. They’ve been helping you with your loan options. Let me connect you with them directly to make sure we’re providing the best assistance. Please hold for a moment.
<span class="intonation">(Use a calm and helpful tone, rising on 'best assistance' and falling on 'hold for a moment'.)</span></li>

<li><strong>19. Handled by Closer (Credit Pull Result: NO RECORD FOUND)</strong><br>
If a credit pull returns 'NO RECORD FOUND,' it usually means the information provided doesn’t match. Let’s confirm your full legal name and billing address to ensure we have accurate details for the next step.
<span class="intonation">(Use a calm, neutral tone. Rising slightly on 'accurate details' and falling on 'next step'.)</span></li>

<li><strong>20. If Account is Frozen, Locked, or Frozen</strong><br>
I understand that unlocking your account may seem like a hassle, but it's quick and secure. Once it’s unlocked, we can continue smoothly with a risk-free soft pull. The credit bureaus can assist you with this process directly, and once unlocked, we can proceed immediately.
<span class="intonation">(Use a supportive tone. Rising slightly on 'quick' and falling on 'proceed immediately'.)</span></li>
