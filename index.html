‚ÄúHey, this is James‚ÄîI‚Äôm with Loan Assistance Center.
How was your day? 


This is regarding about personal loan offer
you can use the loan for personal expenses consolidate or pay off high interest
debts. Since this is a limited time offer I need to ask a few questions.

"If cx hesitate" : 
Have you already spoke to us about the personal loan offer?
I'm not asking you to sign up for the loan just yet. I 
want to ask details to make sure that you meet the minimum requirements to 
take advantage of it.             
                
VERIFICATION 
I want to check if we got your details correct.
Name (spelling)
Phone number 
Email 
Complete home address
Estimated monthly income 

Lastly, I will need to do a soft credit check before connecting you with a loan specialist. This will not affect your credit score in any way.
For this, I'll just need to confirm your date of birth.
Ok, and you're social.

I'm submitting this to the underwriting department now, and it'll just take a few minutes to verify your status (Note: While waiting for the result, take the opportunity to build rapport with the lead. Engage in light conversation)
Stalling questions : 
How much do you owe with your other debts? 
Out of curiosity, how much interest do they charge you with your current loans.
What are your plans if you got approved?                

STATUS DECLINED (Loan CR Agent): Unfortunately, you don't meet the minimum requirements right now, but you're welcome to apply with us again in 60/90 days.
STATUS APPROVED (Loan CR Agent): It looks like you meet the minimum requirements, so we can proceed with transferring you to our specialist.

HANDOFF
Specialist: "Hi, this is Marc, agent ID 1234 with Lendvia, on a recorded line."
CR Agent: "Hi, [Loan Specialist Name], I have [Client Name on the line with file number [Logixx file number. I've confirmed that [Client Name) meets all the minimum  requirements to proceed. Can you please go over the available loan options with them?‚Äù
