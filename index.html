            <h2>Call Script</h2>

Neko's Awesome! COLD CALL SCRIPT – PERSONAL LOAN OFFER (With Intonation & Pacing)

Agent:
Hi, is this [Client Name]? ↑ (friendly, upward tone)

Hey [Client Name], this is [Your Name] from the Personal Loan Intake Team. ↓ (confident, steady tone)
I help people get fast, simple access to personal loans—without the usual hassle. ↓

You’ve been pre-screened for a personal loan starting as low as 5.99%,
and the offer is set to expire in just a few days. ↑ (use urgency here)
So I wanted to make sure you had the chance to check it out before it’s gone. ↓

It’ll just take about 2 minutes, and don’t worry—this won’t affect your credit score. ↓ (reassuring tone, steady pace)
Mind if I ask you a few quick questions? ↑ (upbeat and inviting)


Verification Questions:
Alright, let me just confirm some quick details: ↓

Your name is spelled J-O-H-N S-M-I-T-H, right? ↓

And your best number is (123) 456-7890? ↓

What’s your best email address? ↓

Can you confirm your full mailing address—street, city, state, and ZIP? ↓

And what’s your monthly income after taxes? ↓



Soft Credit Check Setup:
Okay, last step before I transfer you to a loan specialist:
We just need to run a soft credit check to confirm your eligibility. ↓
This will not affect your credit score in any way. ↓ (pause briefly here)

For that, I just need to confirm your date of birth, and the last four digits of your Social. ↓ (calm, non-pushy)


If They Hesitate (Objection Handling):
I totally get that. ↑ (empathetic, gentle)
Just to reassure you—this is encrypted, not stored, and only used to confirm your identity. ↓
In fact, it actually helps protect you, so nobody else can access this offer in your name. ↓

And again, this soft check won’t touch your credit score. ↓ (reaffirm gently)

Objection: “Where did you get my info?”
That’s a great question. ↑
You didn’t sign up directly—but your info came from a credit bureau’s pre-screen list. ↓
We work with providers who use that list to offer lower-rate loan options to folks who may qualify. ↓

It’s a secure, one-time use, and your data is never sold or reused. ↓


IF APPROVED:
Awesome—it looks like you meet the requirements! ↑
I’m now going to connect you with a licensed loan specialist who’ll walk you through the best options. ↓ (smooth, enthusiastic)


IF DECLINED:
Thanks for your time, [Client Name]. ↓
Right now, it looks like you don’t meet the minimum requirements—
but you’re welcome to reapply in 60 to 90 days if anything changes. ↓ (kind, respectful tone)


HANDOFF SECTION

To Specialist:
Hi [Specialist Name], I’ve got [Client Name] on the line. ↓
File number is [Logixx File Number]. ↓
They’ve been verified and meet all the minimum requirements.
Can you walk them through the available loan options?

To Client:
[Client Name], thanks so much for holding. ↓
I’ve got our loan specialist [Specialist Name] on the line now—
they’ll guide you through the rest. ↓
Thanks again, and I hope you both have a great day! ↑      </textarea>

                    step we take is with full accountability and integrity. This process was built to protect you while
                    opening the door to real opportunities. </li>
                <li class="objection-item"><strong>2. Hesitant to Provide SSN</strong> - YYour security matters and
                    that’s
                    why we use bank-level encryption to protect your SSN at every step. We don’t ask for information we
                    don’t need. This allows us to verify your identity and secure the best offers on your behalf—without
                    affecting your credit or exposing your data. It’s the safest way to move forward with full
                    confidence.
                </li>
                <li class="objection-item"><strong>3. “What company is this?”</strong> - We’re Loan Assistance Center
                    trusted partners of top-tier lenders across the country. Our job is to simplify your process, cut
                    through the noise, and connect you with real, affordable options. We’re not here to sell—we’re here
                    to
                    solve, and we do it with professionalism, speed, and purpose. </li>
                <li class="objection-item"><strong>4. “Don’t do a soft pull—I have bad credit.”</strong> - Bad credit
                    doesn’t stop us it just gives us more to work with. Our lenders evaluate your full profile, not just
                    a
                    number. And because this is a soft pull, your score stays completely untouched. It’s your shot at a
                    smarter financial path without risk or penalty. </li>
                <li class="objection-item"><strong>5. Wrong SSN or Info</strong> - To proceed, our system needs
                    verified,
                    accurate information to match you with the right lender. A single mismatch could delay or block your
                    approval. Correcting it now ensures your eligibility and keeps the process seamless from here. </li>
                <li class="objection-item"><strong>6. “I’m not interested” / “Not looking for a loan”</strong> -

                    understand—but what we’re offering isn’t just a loan—it’s a financial reset. Whether you’re facing
                    high-interest debt, unexpected expenses, or just want flexibility, this solution puts control back
                    in
                    your hands. When real options are on the table, walking away means walking away from relief. </li>
                <li class="objection-item"><strong>7. “What’s your exact location?”</strong> - We’re based in Irvine,
                    California, and we work exclusively with a national network of vetted lenders. Once you’re
                    pre-qualified, you’ll get full transparency about the lender, terms, and next steps. Every piece of
                    this
                    process is built on trust, clarity, and compliance. 2525 Main St, Irvine, CA 92614 in front of John
                    Wayne A</li>
                <li class="objection-item"><strong>8. “I don’t have time.”</strong> - That’s exactly why we streamlined
                    this
                    process to take just minutes. What you do today could impact your financial freedom for years. And
                    this
                    limited-time offer doesn’t wait. We’re ready when you are. </li>
                <li class="objection-item"><strong>9. “Why unlock my account for a soft pull?”</strong> - Your account
                    needs
                    to be unlocked so we can complete a risk-free soft inquiry—which has zero effect on your credit
                    score.
                    It’s quick, secure, and the only way we can present accurate, personalized loan terms. It keeps you
                    in
                    control, without compromise.</li>
                <li class="objection-item"><strong>10. “What’s your website or address?”</strong> - Happy to provide all
                    official info—but to protect your identity, we only send sensitive credentials through secure email.
                    That ensures you’re getting verified information directly from underwriting—accurately, safely, and
                    without delay. </li>
                <li class="objection-item"><strong>11. “Why don’t you have my information?”</strong> - We pull data from
                    multiple sources, but to prevent errors or mismatches, we verify directly with you. This ensures
                    that
                    what we send is accurate, tailored, and fully aligned with what you qualify for. No wasted time. No
                    missed opportunity.</li>
                <li class="objection-item"><strong>12. “How are you different from other lenders?”</strong> - Unlike
                    traditional lenders, we fight for your best terms. You get access to low fixed rates starting at
                    5.99%,
                    no collateral required, and real approvals based on your overall financial story—not just your
                    credit
                    score. Add in faster funding and airtight security, and this becomes the smarter, safer way to
                    borrow.
                </li>
                <li class="objection-item"><strong>13. “Soft Pull vs. Hard Pull?”</strong> - A soft pull lets us check
                    your
                    pre-approval status without touching your credit score. It’s invisible to other lenders and leaves
                    zero
                    impact. Hard pulls come later, only with your full consent—but right now, all we’re doing is
                    exploring
                    your best options safely and smartly. </li>
                <li class="objection-item"><strong>14. “Why do you need my email?”</strong> - Your email is the direct
                    line
                    for critical documents, updates, and approvals. It ensures you receive everything in real
                    time—securely
                    and without any delays. This keeps your process smooth, accurate, and fully protected from start to
                    finish. </li>
                <li class="objection-item"><strong>15. “I want info via email first.”</strong> - Absolutely—we respect
                    that.
                    First, we need to confirm key details to make sure the offer we send is real and accurate. Once
                    that’s
                    done, your personalized loan options will be delivered straight to your inbox—secure, tailored, and
                    ready for review….</li>
                <li class="objection-item"><strong>16. “I don’t have an email.”</strong> - That’s completely
                    understandable.
                    But what you’re missing isn’t a sales pitch—it’s a real conversation that could lead to a better
                    rate,
                    faster approval, or bigger savings. It’s free, fast, and handled by experts who are here to help—not
                    pressure. When people hear what’s actually available to them, they’re glad they took the call. </li>
                <li class="objection-item"><strong>17. Doesn’t Want to Talk to Loan Specialist</strong> - That’s
                    completely
                    understandable. But what you’re missing isn’t a sales pitch—it’s a real conversation that could lead
