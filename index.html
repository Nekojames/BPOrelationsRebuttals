PERSONAL LOAN OFFER (With Intonation & Pacing)

Agent:
Hi, is this [Client Name]? ↑ (friendly, upward tone)

Hey [Client Name], this is [Your Name] from the Personal Loan Intake Team. ↓ (confident, steady tone)
I help people get fast, simple access to personal loans—without the usual hassle. ↓

You’ve been pre-screened for a personal loan starting as low as 5.99%,
and the offer is set to expire in just a few days. ↑ (use urgency here)
So I wanted to make sure you had the chance to check it out before it’s gone. ↓

It’ll just take about 5 minutes, and don’t worry—this won’t affect your credit score. ↓ (reassuring tone, steady pace)
Mind if I ask you a few quick questions? ↑ (upbeat and inviting)


Verification Questions:
Alright, let me just confirm some quick details: ↓

Your name is spelled N-A-M-E, right? ↓

And your best number is (PHONE NUMBER ON THE DIALER)? ↓

What’s your best email address? ↓

Can you confirm your full residential address, city, state, and ZIP? ↓

And what’s your monthly income after taxes? ↓



Soft Credit Check Setup:
Okay, last step before I transfer you to a loan specialist:
We just need to run a soft credit check to confirm your eligibility. ↓
This will not affect your credit score in any way. ↓ (pause briefly here)

For that, I just need to confirm your date of birth, and your complete of your Social security number. ↓ (calm, non-pushy)


If They Hesitate (Objection Handling):
I totally get that. ↑ (empathetic, gentle)
Just to reassure you—this is encrypted, not stored, and only used to confirm your identity. ↓
In fact, it actually helps protect you, so nobody else can access this offer in your name. ↓

And again, this soft check won’t touch your credit score. ↓ (reaffirm gently)

Objection: “Where did you get my info?”
That’s a great question. ↑
You didn’t sign up directly—but your info came from a credit bureau’s pre-screen list. ↓
We work with providers who use that list to offer lower-rate loan options to folks who may qualify. ↓

It’s a secure, one-time use, and your data is never sold or reused. ↓

I have submitted the informationt to the undwritting team to check your eligibility this will only take 3 minutes.             

IF APPROVED:
Awesome—it looks like you meet the requirements! ↑
I’m now going to connect you with a licensed loan specialist who’ll walk you through the best options. ↓ (smooth, enthusiastic)


IF DECLINED:
Thanks for your time, [Client Name]. ↓
Right now, it looks like you don’t meet the minimum requirements—
but you’re welcome to reapply in 60 to 90 days if anything changes. ↓ (kind, respectful tone)


HANDOFF SECTION

To Specialist:
Hi [Specialist Name], I’ve got [Client Name] on the line. ↓
File number is [Logixx File Number]. ↓
They’ve been verified and meet all the minimum requirements.
Can you walk them through the available loan options?

To Client:
[Client Name], thanks so much for holding. ↓
I’ve got our loan specialist [Specialist Name] on the line now— 
they’ll guide you through the rest. ↓
Thanks again, and I hope you both have a great day! ↑

    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Don’t do a soft pull—I have bad credit.</strong>
        <p>We don’t judge based on your credit score. Our lenders take a deeper look at your overall financial picture, and since it's a soft pull, your credit score won’t be impacted. It’s an opportunity to see where you stand, risk-free.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Wrong SSN or Info</strong>
        <p>We need accurate info to ensure we match you with the right lender and offer. If there’s an error in your details, it could delay the process, so let's fix it now to keep things moving smoothly.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>I’m not interested / Not looking for a loan</strong>
        <p>That’s totally okay! But think of this as more than just a loan—this is about giving you more control over your finances. Whether it’s lowering debt or accessing better rates, this could be a chance for a fresh start, without any pressure to commit right away.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>What’s your exact location?</strong>
        <p>We’re based in Irvine, California, and partner with a nationwide network of trusted lenders. Once you’re pre-qualified, we’ll share all the details about your lender, terms, and next steps with full transparency.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>I don’t have time.</strong>
        <p>We understand! That’s why we’ve made the process as quick and simple as possible. Just a few minutes now could unlock a much better financial future, and we’re ready to help you every step of the way.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Why unlock my account for a soft pull?</strong>
        <p>Unlocking your account lets us do a soft inquiry, which has no effect on your credit score. It’s a quick and secure way for us to get the right info so we can offer you personalized loan terms that suit you best.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>What’s your website or address?</strong>
        <p>We’ll happily share official info with you. For your protection, sensitive details will only be sent through secure email, ensuring everything is verified and safe from start to finish.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Why don’t you have my information?</strong>
        <p>We gather data from trusted sources, but we always double-check with you directly to make sure everything is accurate and tailored to you. It’s a way for us to avoid mistakes and ensure you get the best possible offer.</p>
    </li>

        <p>Unlike traditional lenders, we look at the bigger picture and offer flexible, low rates starting at 5.99%. We’re focused on getting you the best possible terms, without the hassle, and we approve loans based on your overall financial story—not just your credit score.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Soft Pull vs. Hard Pull?</strong>
        <p>A soft pull lets us check your eligibility without affecting your credit score. Only after you’ve agreed to proceed will a hard pull take place. For now, we’re just trying to explore your options with zero risk to you.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Why do you need my email?</strong>
        <p>Your email is where we’ll send important updates, documents, and approvals. It’s the fastest, most secure way to keep you in the loop, without any delays or lost information.</p>

    <li>
        <strong>I don’t have an email.</strong>
        <p>No worries! We’ve helped plenty of people without email. It’s just a quick conversation, free of pressure, that could give you access to better loan terms and rates than you might expect.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Doesn’t Want to Talk to Loan Specialist</strong>

    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Handled by Closer</strong>
        <p>If you're already working with one of our Senior Loan Advisors, I’ll make sure they pick up where they left off. I see they were helping you with your application, and I’ll connect you right away so you’re not waiting any longer.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>No Record Found</strong>
        <p>If no record was found, it likely means there was a small error in the info provided. Let’s just double-check your name and billing address to ensure everything matches up correctly so we can move forward.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Why do I need to unlock my account for this soft credit pull?</strong>
        <p>Unlocking your account is the only way for us to do a soft pull and ensure we have the right information to proceed. It’s easy and quick to do, and once it's unlocked, we can continue the process without any delays.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>When encountering a customer already being handled by a closer, don't just transfer them without context.</strong>
        <p>It’s important to give the customer context before transferring. For example, you could say: "I see you spoke with our Senior Loan Advisor, and they were helping you with the program. I’ll connect you with them to pick up where they left off. Please hold on while I do that."</p>
