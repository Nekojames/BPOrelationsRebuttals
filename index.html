‚ÄúHello, this is James‚ÄîI‚Äôm with Loan Assistance Center.
How's your day? 


This is regarding about personal loan offer
you can use the loan for personal expenses consolidate or pay off high interest
debts. Since this is a limited time offer I need to ask a few questions.

"If cx hesitate" : 
Have you already spoke to us about the personal loan offer?
I'm not asking you to sign up for the loan just yet. I 
want to ask details to make sure that you meet the minimum requirements to 
take advantage of it.             
                
VERIFICATION 
I want to check if we got your details correct.
Name (spelling)
Phone number 
Email 
Complete home address
Estimated monthly income 

Lastly, I will need to do a soft credit check before connecting you with a loan specialist. This will not affect your credit score in any way.
For this, I'll just need to confirm your date of birth.
Ok, and you're social.

I'm submitting this to the underwriting department now, and it'll just take a few minutes to verify your status (Note: While waiting for the result, take the opportunity to build rapport with the lead. Engage in light conversation)
Stalling questions : 
How much do you owe with your other debts? 
Out of curiosity, how much interest do they charge you with your current loans.
What are your plans if you got approved?                

STATUS DECLINED (Loan CR Agent): Unfortunately, you don't meet the minimum requirements right now, but you're welcome to apply with us again in 60/90 days.
STATUS APPROVED (Loan CR Agent): It looks like you meet the minimum requirements, so we can proceed with transferring you to our specialist.

HANDOFF
Specialist: "Hi, this is Marc, agent ID 1234 with Lendvia, on a recorded line."
CR Agent: "Hi, [Loan Specialist Name], I have [Client Name on the line with file number [Logixx file number. I've confirmed that [Client Name) meets all the minimum  requirements to proceed. Can you please go over the available loan options with them?‚Äù
CR Agent: Hello (Customer)thank you for waiting. I have my loan specialist (Name) and he/she will help you further. Thank you for your time, you both have a GREAT day!

    <p>As a licensed lender, we lawfully access data through secure, verified credit bureaus to identify individuals pre-qualified for exclusive financial solutions. Your privacy is safeguarded by federal compliance standards, and every step we take is with full accountability and integrity. This process was built to protect you while opening the door to real opportunities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Hesitant to Provide SSN</strong>
    <p>Your security matters and that‚Äôs why we use bank-level encryption to protect your SSN at every step. We don‚Äôt ask for information we don‚Äôt need. This allows us to verify your identity and secure the best offers on your behalf‚Äîwithout affecting your credit or exposing your data. It‚Äôs the safest way to move forward with full confidence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>‚ÄúWhat company is this?‚Äù</strong>
    <p>We‚Äôre Loan Assistance Center trusted partners of top-tier lenders across the country. Our job is to simplify your process, cut through the noise, and connect you with real, affordable options. We‚Äôre not here to sell‚Äîwe‚Äôre here to solve, and we do it with professionalism, speed, and purpose.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do a soft pull, I have bad credit.‚Äù</strong>
    <p>Bad credit doesn‚Äôt stop us; it just gives us more to work with. Our lenders evaluate your full profile, not just a number. And because this is a soft pull, your score stays completely untouched. It‚Äôs your shot at a smarter financial path without risk or penalty.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Wrong SSN or Info</strong>
    <p>To proceed, our system needs verified, accurate information to match you with the right lender. A single mismatch could delay or block your approval. Correcting it now ensures your eligibility and keeps the process seamless from here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>‚ÄúI‚Äôm not interested‚Äù / ‚ÄúNot looking for a loan‚Äù</strong>
    <p>Completely understand‚Äîbut what we‚Äôre offering isn‚Äôt just a loan‚Äîit‚Äôs a financial reset. Whether you‚Äôre facing high-interest debt, unexpected expenses, or just want flexibility, this solution puts control back in your hands. When real options are on the table, walking away means walking away from relief.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your exact location?‚Äù</strong>
    <p>We‚Äôre based in Irvine, California, and we work exclusively with a national network of vetted lenders. Once you‚Äôre pre-qualified, you‚Äôll get full transparency about the lender, terms, and next steps. Every piece of this process is built on trust, clarity, and compliance. 2525 Main St, Irvine, CA 92614 in front of John Wayne Airport.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have time.‚Äù</strong>
    <p>That‚Äôs exactly why we streamlined this process to take just minutes. What you do today could impact your financial freedom for years. And this limited-time offer doesn‚Äôt wait. We‚Äôre ready when you are.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>‚ÄúWhy unlock my account for a soft pull?‚Äù</strong>
    <p>Your account needs to be unlocked so we can complete a risk-free soft inquiry‚Äîwhich has zero effect on your credit score. It‚Äôs quick, secure, and the only way we can present accurate, personalized loan terms. It keeps you in control, without compromise.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your website or address?‚Äù</strong>
    <p>Happy to provide all official info‚Äîbut to protect your identity, we only send sensitive credentials through secure email. That ensures you‚Äôre getting verified information directly from underwriting‚Äîaccurately, safely, and without delay.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you have my information?‚Äù</strong>
    <p>We pull data from multiple sources, but to prevent errors or mismatches, we verify directly with you. This ensures that what we send is accurate, tailored, and fully aligned with what you qualify for. No wasted time. No missed opportunity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

    <p>Unlike traditional lenders, we fight for your best terms. You get access to low fixed rates starting at 5.99%, no collateral required, and real approvals based on your overall financial story‚Äînot just your credit score. Add in faster funding and airtight security, and this becomes the smarter, safer way to borrow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>‚ÄúSoft Pull vs. Hard Pull?‚Äù</strong>
    <p>A soft pull lets us check your pre-approval status without touching your credit score. It‚Äôs invisible to other lenders and leaves zero impact. Hard pulls come later, only with your full consent‚Äîbut right now, all we‚Äôre doing is exploring your best options safely and smartly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>‚ÄúWhy do you need my email?‚Äù</strong>
    <p>Your email is the direct line for critical documents, updates, and approvals. It ensures you receive everything in real time‚Äîsecurely and without any delays. This keeps your process smooth, accurate, and fully protected from start to finish.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>‚ÄúI want info via email first.‚Äù</strong>
    <p>Absolutely‚Äîwe respect that. First, we need to confirm key details to make sure the offer we send is real and accurate. Once that‚Äôs done, your personalized loan options will be delivered straight to your inbox‚Äîsecure, tailored, and ready for review‚Ä¶</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have an email.‚Äù</strong>
    <p>No problem at all. If a trusted friend or family member has one we can use temporarily for your paperwork, great. If not, we‚Äôll use a secure placeholder to keep your application moving forward with zero delay.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Doesn‚Äôt Want to Talk to Loan Specialist</strong>
    <p>That‚Äôs completely understandable. But what you‚Äôre missing isn‚Äôt a sales pitch‚Äîit‚Äôs a real conversation that could lead to a better rate, faster approval, or bigger savings. It‚Äôs free, fast, and handled by experts who are here to help‚Äînot pressure. When people hear what‚Äôs actually available to them, they‚Äôre glad they took the call.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>WHEN YOU ENCOUNTER A CUSTOMER WHO IS ALREADY BEING HANDLED BY A CLOSER, DON'T JUST TRANSFER THEM WITHOUT GIVING THEM CONTEXT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED!</strong>
    <p>'I see here that you spoke with our Senior Loan Advisor and he/she was assisting you with the program. In order for us to provide you the best assistance, I will connect you with that Senior Advisor. His/her name is (SA NAME). Please stay on the line while I connect you.'</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Reminder for Credit Pull Process</strong>
    <p>Please be reminded that if the result of a credit pull returns as "NO RECORD FOUND," it typically indicates that incorrect information was provided by the agent. This could be due to discrepancies in the details entered during the process. To ensure accurate results and avoid delays, please double-check and confirm the following information with the client before submitting.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Legal Name: "Can you please confirm your full legal name as it appears on your card?" Please spell it out for me.</li>
      <li>Billing Address: "Can you confirm the utility/billing address associated with your account?"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>IF FROZEN, FREEZE OR LOCKED</strong>
    <p>Cx: "Why do I need to unlock my account for this soft credit pull?"</p>
    <p>Rebuttal: "I understand your concern. The reason we need to unlock your account is so we can proceed with the soft credit pull, which is completely free of charge. It's a standard procedure to ensure we have the necessary information to continue with the process smoothly. You can easily unlock your account by either calling the credit bureau directly or visiting their website."</p>
    <p>Cx: I'm not sure about calling the credit bureau.</p>
    <p>Rebuttal: "I completely understand. It may seem like an extra step, but it‚Äôs a quick process. The credit bureaus, like Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion, have dedicated support teams to help with unlocking your account. You can either call them or go to their website to do this securely. Once it‚Äôs unlocked, we can proceed without any delays. It's really just a few minutes, and after that, we‚Äôre good to go."</p>
